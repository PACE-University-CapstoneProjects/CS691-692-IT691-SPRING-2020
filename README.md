Software Bug Triage Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing

Team Members: Frank Russo, Ramya Raju, Carlo Clarke.

Customers: Ning Yang, Anthony Escalona.

All software written even today has bugs or defects.
It is critical to fix bugs as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Triaging bugs can be time-consuming, especially on larger teams
or with larger projects. The process of assigning bugs to the
proper developer is a task that can easily be automated and is
a good exercise for using Machine Learning concepts. We will
be studying sample data from the Google Chromium project
using Machine Learning to analyze bugs by title and description
to determine the best owner of a defect. We will use Natural
Language Processing to analyze the bug title and description,
looking for patterns to determine the correct developers to assign
to bugs.
